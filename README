INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to yukon! If you haven't done so already, please go take a look at:

	http://www.neopsis.com/projects/yukon

This site typically covers all the basics of setup, configuration, and
troubleshooting. However, this document will act as a supplement to that
information.

First and foremost, you MUST have libseom installed! Yukon is now built and
linked against Seom, and will not run otherwise. Second of all, please
realize that Yukon and Seom are still beta applications, and so there
will be bugs. ;)


BUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the 'build.sh' script to compile and install yukon. The script uses two
environment variables if they are present: 'CC' and 'LIBPATH'. Usually you
don't need to set them, but if you have a 64bit userspace and want to
compile yukon into a 32bit library, you need to set 'CC="gcc -m32"' and
'LIBPATH="lib32"', so that the compiler knows to produce 32bit objects and
where it can find the 32bit libX11.so and libGL.so.

Note that some distributions don't have libX11.so under /usr/lib32 (gentoo
for example). On such systems you need to copy the 32bit libX11.so to
/usr/lib32 or make a symlink from /usr/lib32/libX11.so to the real location.
On gentoo that would be (as root):

	$ ln -s /emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libX11.so /usr/lib32/libX11.so

Once the build completes, you'll notice a new directory called .yukon has
been created in your HOME directory. Don't worry too much about it's 
purpose for now, it is mainly there to facilitate the libGL interception
Yukon must implement to function properly.
