Use the 'build.sh' script to compile and install yukon. The script uses two
environment variables if they are present: 'CC' and 'LIBPATH'. Usually you
don't need to set them, but if you have a 64bit userspace and want to
compile yukon into a 32bit library, you need to set 'CC="gcc -m32"' and
'LIBPATH="lib32"', so that the compiler knows to produce 32bit objects and
where it can find the 32bit libX11.so and libGL.so.

Note that some distributions don't have libX11.so under /usr/lib32 (gentoo
for example). On such systems you need to copy the 32bit libX11.so to
/usr/lib32 or make a symlink from /usr/lib32/libX11.so to the real location.
On gentoo that would be (as root):
$ ln -s /emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libX11.so /usr/lib32/libX11.so
