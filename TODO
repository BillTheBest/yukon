- Consider support for application "namespaces" again using /proc/self.
- Create an automated test suite. I've noticed a lot of crashing lately
  on my own system, which I plan on investigating w/ valgrind.
- Finish the template yukon.conf file. :)
- FIX THE BUILD SYSTEM. :) It's not broken or anything, I just need to
  make it a little more versatile.
